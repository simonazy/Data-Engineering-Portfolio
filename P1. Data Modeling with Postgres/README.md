# Data Modeling with Postgres

I apply Data Modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. 

Assume a starup company wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

Currently, the JSON data resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

## My data sources:

### **Song Dataset**
Songs dataset is a subset of [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/).

Sample Record :
```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### **Log Dataset**
Logs dataset is generated by [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).

Sample Record :
```
{"artist": null, "auth": "Logged In", "firstName": "Walter", "gender": "M", "itemInSession": 0, "lastName": "Frye", "length": null, "level": "free", "location": "San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA", "method": "GET","page": "Home", "registration": 1540919166796.0, "sessionId": 38, "song": null, "status": 200, "ts": 1541105830796, "userAgent": "\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"", "userId": "39"}
```

### Files used on the project:

1. **data** folder nested at the home of the project, where all needed jsons reside.
2. **sql_queries.py** contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
3. **create_tables.py** drops and creates tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
4. **etl.py** reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. 

### Break down of steps

1 Wrote DROP, CREATE and INSERT query statements in sql_queries.py

2 Run in console
 ```
python create_tables.py
```

The schema I used is the Star Schema: 
There is one main **fact table** containing all the measures associated to each event (user song plays), and 4 **dimensional tables**, each with a primary key that is being referenced from the fact table.


#### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of each user song play 
- start_time (DATE) NOT NULL: Timestamp of beggining of user activity
- user_id (INT) NOT NULL: ID of user
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}
- song_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Song played
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Artist of the song played
- session_id (INT): ID of the user Session 
- location (TEXT): User location 
- user_agent (TEXT): Agent used by user to access Sparkify platform

#### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
- user_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of user
- first_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of user
- last_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Last Name of user
- gender (TEXT): Gender of user {M | F}
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}

**songs** - songs in music database
- song_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Song
- title (TEXT) NOT NULL: Title of Song
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of song Artist
- year (INT): Year of song release
- duration (FLOAT) NOT NULL: Song duration in milliseconds

**artists** - artists in music database
- artist_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Artist
- name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of Artist
- location (TEXT): Name of Artist city
- lattitude (FLOAT): Lattitude location of artist
- longitude (FLOAT): Longitude location of artist

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- start_time (DATE) PRIMARY KEY: Timestamp of row
- hour (INT): Hour associated to start_time
- day (INT): Day associated to start_time
- week (INT): Week of year associated to start_time
- month (INT): Month associated to start_time 
- year (INT): Year associated to start_time
- weekday (TEXT): Name of week day associated to start_time

3 Run etl in console, and verify results:
 ```
python etl.py
```

### Finally I test song and artist id from their tables by song name, artist name and song duration that we have on our song play dataset. The magic query used is the following:

```

        %SELECT song_id, artists.artist_id
        FROM songs JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.artist_id
        WHERE songs.title = %s
        AND artists.name = %s
        AND songs.duration = %s
 
```
